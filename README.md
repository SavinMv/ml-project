# Spam Email Detection

A simple spam detection system using Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing (NLP).

✅ Cleans and preprocesses text (lowercasing, removing stopwords, stemming)
✅ Converts text to numerical form using **TF-IDF**
✅ Trains a **Naïve Bayes classifier** for spam detection
✅ Predicts whether a message is **spam or not**
